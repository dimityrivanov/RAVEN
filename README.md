RAVEN
=====

Open source educational robot

Description
====
Nowadays, technologies are advancing rapidly fast,scientist and engineers are trying to make everything smaller and more functional,because of that there are people that can't learn the tehnology they provide,because its either hard to learn or not easy to use.
NASA is one example for that,every year they are trying to inovate and thing of the best way to produce something here on Earth that can survive on other planets and surroundings,If we think a little there are a lot of interesting stuff that non engineers,hobbyists,students,childrens want to try,but often what stops them its the funding or the mass contruction of the 'thing'.
Our project **RAVEN** is trying to clear these problem by providing easy to use platform + control API which gives the freedom to user to setup any kind of platform he likes for any enviroment and any type of hardware.
**RAVEN** construction
====
**RAVEN** is constructed from the following parts and materials:   
**Rover 5 Robot Platform** -> https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10336   
**Raspberry Pi Model B** -> We chosed this pc,because the main concept of it was to provide computers all over the world mostlly in poor cities for educational purpose and not only.
Using this computer we can control one camera which stream directly video on the web and take picture when the robot meet obstacle,after that you can see that picture on the map which the rover creates for you.   
**Arduino** -> A fully open source inviroment with tons of examples giving you idea how to start,it is ideal platform for us,because we want the user to make their prototypes easily without a lot of effort.
In our case arduino handles the whole object avoidance algorithm.   
**Web** -> Because we live in 21 century we created website using latest tehnology in rendering and communication which allowed us to show video live stream and real time map making with obsticle integration where user not only can see whats going on but also can send commands to the robot.
